        "It's easier to think of the opposite event: \"no two of the 30 people share a birthday.\"  \nThat opposite probability is  \n\nP(no match) = 365\u00b7364\u00b7\u2026\u00b7336 / 365\u00b3\u2070 \u2248 0.2937.\n\nTherefore the probability requested (\"at least two do not share a birthday\") is the complement  \n\n1 \u2013 0.2937 \u2248 0.7063, i.e. about 70.6%.",
        "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's clarify what the question is asking. We have a room with 30 people, and we want to find the probability that **at least two people do not share a birthday**. \n\nThis is the opposite of the more commonly known \"Birthday Problem,\" which asks for the probability that **at least two people share a birthday**. \n\nSo, the probability that at least two do not share a birthday is essentially the complement of the probability that all 30 people have unique birthdays. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think carefully.\n\nActually, \"at least two do not share a birthday\" implies that **not everyone shares a birthday with someone else**. In other words, there is at least one pair of people who do not share a birthday. \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that **not all 30 people have the same birthday** (which would be the extreme case where everyone shares the same birthday), but more generally, it's that the birthdays are not all paired up in such a way that everyone shares with someone. \n\nBut actually, in a group of 30, the only way that \"at least two do not share a birthday\" is false is if **all 30 have unique birthdays**, because if any two share, then the remaining could share or not, but \"at least two do not share\" would still hold unless all birthdays are unique. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. \n\nLet me rephrase: \n\nThe statement \"at least two do not share a birthday\" means that there exists at least two people whose birthdays are different. \n\nThis is the complement of \"all people share birthdays in such a way that no two are different,\" which is impossible unless all 30 have the same birthday, which is extremely unlikely. \n\nBut actually, the only way that \"at least two do not share a birthday\" is false is if **all 30 have the same birthday**, because if even one person has a different birthday, then those two don't share. \n\nBut that can't be right because in a group of 30, unless all were born on the same day, at least two don't share. \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler: \n\nThe probability that at least two do not share a birthday is the same as 1 minus the probability that all 30 share the same birthday. \n\nBecause if all 30 share the same birthday, then it's not true that at least two do not share. In every other case, at least two do not share. \n\nSo, the probability that at least two do not share is:\n\n1 - P(all 30 share the same birthday).\n\n### Calculating P(all 30 share the same birthday)\n\nAssuming that birthdays are uniformly distributed across 365 days (ignoring leap years), the probability that all 30 people share the same birthday is:\n\nThe first person can have any birthday (365/365), and then every subsequent person must have that same birthday (1/365 each).\n\nSo, P(all same) = (1/365)^29.\n\nThis is because the first person's birthday is arbitrary, and then the next 29 must match it.\n\n### Calculating the Desired Probability\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least two do not share a birthday is:\n\nP(at least two do not share) = 1 - P(all 30 share) = 1 - (1/365)^29.\n\n### Evaluating the Numerical Value\n\nNow, let's compute (1/365)^29:\n\nThis is an extremely small number. \n\n365^29 is a huge number, so 1/365^29 is practically zero for our purposes.\n\nThus, 1 - (1/365)^29 is approximately 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n### Verifying the Interpretation\n\nIs this interpretation correct? Let me think differently: \n\nIn a group of 30, the only way that it's not true that \"at least two do not share a birthday\" is if all 30 share the same birthday. \n\nIn every other scenario, even if many share, as long as not all share, there are at least two who don't. \n\nFor example, if 29 share one birthday and 1 has a different one, then those two (the 29th and the 1) do not share. \n\nSimilarly, if all have unique birthdays, then certainly at least two do not share. \n\nThus, the only case where \"at least two do not share\" is false is the trivial case where all 30 share the same birthday, which is astronomically unlikely. \n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed essentially 1.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe probability that at least two people do not share a birthday in a room of 30 people is approximately:\n\n**1 (or essentially 100%)**\n\nMore precisely, it is:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{365}\\right)^{29} \\]\n\nwhich is so close to 1 that for all practical purposes, it can be considered as 1. \n\nIn other words, it is almost certain that in a group of 30 people, at least two will not share a birthday. The only exception is the vanishingly unlikely scenario where all 30 were born on the same day.",
        "We need to find the probability that **at least two people in a room of 30 do *not*** share a birthday.\n\nBut this phrasing is ambiguous. Let's interpret it carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Clarifying the question\n\n> \"What's the probability that **at least two do not share a birthday**?\"\n\nThis is **not** the same as the classic birthday problem, which asks:\n\n> \"What's the probability that **at least two people share a birthday**?\"\n\nSo we need to compute:\n\n> **The probability that *not all* 30 people have *unique* birthdays.**\n\nIn other words, we want:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least two people share a birthday}) = 1 - P(\\text{all 30 have unique birthdays})\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Compute the classic birthday probability\n\nAssume 365 days in a year (ignore leap years).\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all unique}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\cdot \\frac{364}{365} \\cdot \\frac{363}{365} \\cdots \\frac{336}{365}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least two share}) = 1 - \\prod_{k=0}^{29} \\frac{365 - k}{365}\n\\]\n\nThis product is approximately:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least two share}) \\approx \\boxed{0.7063}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.7063}\n\\]\n\nSo, there's approximately a **70.63%** chance that **at least two people share a birthday** in a room of 30 people \u2014 which is the same as saying:\n\n> There's a **70.63%** chance that **not all 30 people have unique birthdays**, i.e., **at least two do *not* have unique birthdays**."

That means **you already lost** \u2014 the car is **not** behind Door #1.\n\nNow you're choosing between Door #2 and Door #3, with **no new information** about either. This is essentially a **new game** between two remaining doors, with a **50/50 chance** the car is behind either one.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Switching or sticking** between Door #2 and Door #3 **does not change your odds**.\n- **Your chance is 50%** either way.\n\n**Answer: It doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 you have a 50% chance either way.**",
        "You originally picked Door #1, which Monty opened and revealed a goat\u2014so Door #1 is no longer in play. That leaves only Doors #2 and #3. Monty now offers you a final choice between those two remaining doors: stay with Door #3 or switch to Door #2.\n\nBecause both remaining doors are still closed and the car is equally likely to be behind either one (Monty didn\u2019t give any new information about Doors #2 or #3), the odds are 50-50. So:\n\n**It makes no difference\u2014switching or staying gives you the same 1-out-of-2 chance of winning the car.**",
        "In this scenario, **you already know Door #1 had a goat**, and **you\u2019ve already switched to Door #3**. Now Monty is asking if you want to **stick with Door #3 or switch to Door #2**.\n\nSince **both remaining doors (Door #2 and Door #3) are still unopened**, and **no new information has been revealed about either**, the situation is now **effectively a 50/50 choice** between the two remaining doors.\n\nSo, **it doesn\u2019t matter whether you stick with Door #3 or switch to Door #2** \u2014 your odds of winning the car are **1 in 2 either way**."

Farmer takes the goat across first (the wolf\u2019s bestie is safely out of ear-shot).  \n2. Farmer returns alone, leaving the goat on the far bank.  While the goat is gone, the wolf chats freely with the cabbage; the detective snaps photos of the wolf\u2019s ledger and records incriminating talk about \u201ctonight\u2019s shipment of contraband beets.\u201d  \n3. Farmer takes the wolf across.  Now the goat and wolf are reunited, but the detective is left back on the original bank with the farmer.  \n4. Farmer brings the goat back to the original side.  This second stretch gives the cabbage another chance to tag the goat\u2019s satchel with a tracker.  \n5. Farmer takes the cabbage (detective) across.  Evidence secured, detective now has photos, recordings, and a GPS trail.  \n6. Farmer goes back for the goat one last time; everyone ends on the far bank, the wolf and goat none the wiser, and the farmer hands the detective the collected proof of vegetable theft.",

        "The farmer can help the undercover cabbage detective gather evidence by ensuring the cabbage is left alone with the wolf and goat at key moments\u2014since the cabbage is investigating *vegetable* theft, not *meat* theft. The wolf and goat, being best friends and business partners, are unlikely to eat the cabbage, but they might incriminate themselves by discussing their operations in its presence. The farmer should strategically ferry them across the river in a way that maximizes the cabbage\u2019s opportunities to overhear incriminating conversations, especially when the goat and wolf think no humans are around."

Instead, they open one **at random** and it **happens** to be flawless.\n\nIn this case, since the host\u2019s action was **not** informed (i.e., they didn\u2019t avoid the defective box), the probability that the contestant\u2019s originally chosen box is defective **does not change** based on the new information. So, switching or staying gives **equal probability** \u2014 1 in 3 \u2014 of picking the defective box.\n\nThus, **there\u2019s no advantage in switching**.

        "The contestant should **stick with their original choice**.\n\nHere\u2019s why: This is a classic probability puzzle, similar in spirit to the Monty Hall problem, but with a key difference.\n\n- Initially, the contestant picks one box out of four.  \n- The host then opens **one** of the remaining **three** boxes and shows that it contains a **flawless** appliance.  \n- Importantly, the host **knows** which box is defective (if any), and **deliberately** opens a flawless one.\n\nNow, the question is: should the contestant **switch** to one of the remaining unopened boxes?\n\nIn this version, **switching does not improve the odds**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Probability the contestant picked the defective one initially: **1/4**.\n- Probability the defective one is among the other three: **3/4**.\n- After the host opens one flawless box from the remaining three, the **3/4 probability** is now split between the **two remaining unopened boxes**, so **each has 3/8 probability** of being defective.\n- The original box still has **1/4 = 2/8** probability.\n\nSo, **the remaining unopened boxes are slightly more likely to contain the defective one** than the original choice. Thus, **the contestant should stick with the original box**, as it has the **lowest chance** of being defective.",

Nothing else has changed: each of the four original boxes still had the same 1-in-4 chance of being the defective one (if there even is a defective one). With one box eliminated as good, the remaining three are all still equally likely to be the defective unit, so the contestant might as well choose any of them."

        "This is a classic **Fibonacci sequence** problem, similar to the original rabbit problem posed by Fibonacci himself.\n\n### Given:\n- Each pair of rabbits gives birth to **2 baby rabbits** (i.e., 1 pair) **every year starting from their second year**.\n- You start with **1 rabbit** (assumed to be a newborn pair, since rabbits reproduce in pairs).\n- You want to know how many **rabbits** (not pairs) there are after **7 years**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- \\( F(n) \\) = number of **pairs** of rabbits after \\( n \\) years.\n\nInitial conditions:\n- \\( F(0) = 1 \\) (we start with 1 pair)\n- \\( F(1) = 1 \\) (still 1 pair, too young to reproduce)\n\nFrom year 2 onward:\n- Each pair that is at least 2 years old produces a new pair.\n- So the recurrence is:\n  \\[\n  F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n  \\]\n\nCompute up to year 7:\n\n| Year | Pairs (F(n)) |\n|------|---------------|\n| 0    | 1             |\n| 1    | 1             |\n| 2    | 2             |\n| 3    | 3             |\n| 4    | 5             |\n| 5    | 8             |\n| 6    | 13            |\n| 7    | 21            |\n\nSo after 7 years, there are **21 pairs** of rabbits.\n\nSince each pair = 2 rabbits:\n\n\\[\n21 \\times 2 = \\boxed{42 \\text{ rabbits}}\n\\]",
